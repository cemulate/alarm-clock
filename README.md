# Alarm Clock

Simple low effort alarm clock; just type in the a time like "12" or "2:30" and an alarm will be set for the next instance of that time.
You can also type durations like "5 minutes" or "2 seconds".
Mainly a learning exercise in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) (featuring [vue-custom-element](https://karol-f.github.io/vue-custom-element/#/)!)
